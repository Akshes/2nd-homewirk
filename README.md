1. Declare = used to set execution directives for a block of code.
2. Abstract class = the parent's class declaration must be defined by the child; additionally, these methods must be 
defined with the same visibility
3. public = class property.
4.  public user = calls user or creates one.
5.  int = integers
6.  Final Class = which keeps child classes from abrogating a strategy by prefixing the definition with last. On the off 
  chance that the class itself is being characterized last, at that point it can't be expanded.
7.  return = returns program control to the calling module.
8. Extends = the subclass inherits all of the public and protected methods from the parent class.
 9. Void = void as their return type must either omit their return statement altogether, or use an empty return statement.
10.  New = adds new name.
 11. $this =  is available when a method is called from within an object context.
12.  ::class = You don't have to store your class names in strings anymore. So, many IDEs can retrieve these class names 
 13.  when you refactor your code.
14. AsertInstanceOf() = Reports an error.
 15. AssertClassHasAttribute = Asserts that a class has a specified attribute.
 16. AssertTrue = In PHPUnit, assertTrue and assertFalse are type-dependent, strict checks. assertTrue($x) checks whether TRUE 
  === $x, it is the same as assertSame(TRUE, $x), and not the same as assertEquals(TRUE, $x).
 17. AssertEquals = Checks that two variables are equal. If you’re comparing floating-point values, you can specify the 
  optional “delta” parameter which dictates how great of a precision error are you willing to tolerate in order to
  consider the two values equal.
